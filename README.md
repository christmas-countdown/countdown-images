# countdown-images

25 images for the [Christmas Countdown bot for Discord](https://github.com/christmas-countdown/bot) with animated snow.

I thought it would be quicker to manually make the 25 input images (`with-text/`, made with PenPot) than write code to automate it.
I'm not sure I was right. 

Unfortunately, `11` looks a bit rubbish but Discord doesn't support other animated image formats so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
